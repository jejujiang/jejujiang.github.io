title: what's C?
---

Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space character (blank, tab, newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but is permits us to illusrate several sapects of C in one program. There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array to hold the number of occurrences of each digit, rather than ten individual variables. Here is one version of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* counts digits, white space, others */
main()
{
  int c, i, nwhite, nother;
  int ndigit[10];

  nwhite = nother = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    ndigit[i] = 0;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
      ++ndigit[c-'0'];
    else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
      ++nwhite;
    else
      ++nother;

  printf("digits =");
  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
  printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n",
      nwhite, nother);
}
```
